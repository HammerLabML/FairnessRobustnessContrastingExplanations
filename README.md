# Fairness and Robustness of Contrasting Explanations

This repository contains the implementation of the methods proposed in the paper [Fairness and Robustness of Contrasting Explanations](paper.pdf) by Andr√© Artelt and Barbara Hammer.

The experiments as described in the paper are implemented in the folder [Code](Code/).

### Note on the implementation for decision trees

Note that the provided implementation of our proposed methods is *NOT efficiently implemented for decision trees!* There is a lot of room for improvements like pruning of leafs and high-density ellipsoids.
